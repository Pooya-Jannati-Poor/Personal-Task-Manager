## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project is built upon a multi-module **Clean Architecture**, which separates the code into independent layers to improve scalability, maintainability, and testability.

> **UI ‚Üí Domain ‚Üê Data**

- **`:presentation` (UI Layer):** Built with **XML** and the **MVVM** pattern. It observes state from ViewModels and is responsible for all user interactions.
- **`:domain` (Domain Layer):** The core of the application. Contains business logic, models, and use cases. This is a pure Kotlin module with no dependencies on the Android framework.
- **`:data` (Data Layer):** Acts as the Single Source of Truth. It manages data from various sources, including the network API and local database, and exposes it to the domain layer.
